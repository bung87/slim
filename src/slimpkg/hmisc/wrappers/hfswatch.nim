## Path filtering

From libfswatch documentation https://emcrisostomo.github.io/fswatch/doc/1.14.0/libfswatch.html/path-filtering.html

    A filter type (fsw_filter_type) determines whether the filter regular
    expression is used to include and exclude paths from the list of the
    events processed by the library. libfswatch processes filters this way:

    - If a path matches an including filter, the path is accepted no matter
      any other filter.
    - If a path matches an excluding filter, the path is rejected.
    - If a path matches no lters, the path is accepted.

    Said another way:

    - All paths are accepted by default, unless an exclusion filter
      says otherwise.
    - Inclusion filters may override any other exclusion filter.
    - The order in the filter definition has no effect.

To simplify creation of regular expressions (especially considering two
different flavors can be specified, each one different from pcre that nim
uses) it is recommended to use `rx` helper

    ##[

A function pointer of type FSW_CEVENT_CALLBACK is used by the API as a
callback to provide information about received events.

The callback is passed the following arguments:

- @arg{events} :: a const pointer to an array of events of type
  `const FswCevent`.
- @arg{eventNum} :: the size of the *events array.
- @arg{data} :: optional persisted data for a callback.

The memory used by the fsw_cevent objects will be freed at the end of the
callback invocation. A callback should copy such data instead of storing a
pointer to it.
